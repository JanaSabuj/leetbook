# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring \(LPS\)

A palindrome center can be in total of \(N + 1 - 2\) + N points = **2N - 1 centers**

```text
even palindromes have centers b/w 2 letters
odd palindromes have centers on each letter

  a  b  c  d
  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^
  total = 2*4 - 1 = 7 centers
```

Extend on both sides from each center

TC = \(2N - 1\) \* N = O\(N^2\)
