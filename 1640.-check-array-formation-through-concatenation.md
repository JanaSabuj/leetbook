# 1640. Check Array Formation Through Concatenation

## Concept

```cpp
[49,18,16, 5, 2, 44, 1]
let us take an array of distinct integers

the order of this array can be preserved by assigning the 
index positions of each element to itself.

rewrite the array as 
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

SO, for each chunk/piece, check if it is a continuous sequence
of consecutive numbers + each element is present in the
original array (do this using a map)
```
