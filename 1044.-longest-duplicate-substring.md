# 1044. Longest Duplicate Substring

Looking at the constraints, **N = 3 \* 10^4**

```cpp
LCS method TC = N*N = 9 * 10^8 [TLE]
SC = N*N*4B = 36 * 10^8 B = 3.6 GB [MLE]
```

We can use Binary Search to find which length L will be the longest. Bcoz if len x is a valid length, then we must go for len &gt; x to the right. 

If len x is invalid, all len &gt; x will also be invalid. So we move to the left in BS.

Trie will be slightly slower both in space and time \(very tight constraints\). So go for Rolling Hash \(Rabin Karp\).
