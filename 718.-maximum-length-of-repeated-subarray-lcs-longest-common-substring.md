# 718. Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray \(LCS - Longest Common Substring\)

The idea is same as of LCSubsequence, except that the **dp state's meaning is different.**

```cpp
dp[i][j] = len of substring ending at A[i-1] and B[j-1]
         = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] if A[i-1] == B[j-1]
         = 0 if A[i-1] != B[j-1]
         
In the end, we take the max value out of the dp matrix
```
